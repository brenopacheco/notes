* .i files

 The .i files are also called as "Pure C files". In preprocessing stage
     -> Header files will be included.
     -> Macros will be replaced.
     -> Comments are removed.
     -> Used for conditional compilation. If you look at the .i file you can see these things.
 	-> gcc -E foo.c -o foo.i

   source -> preprocessed -> machine code -> object -> executable
 	.c,.h -> .i -> .s -> .o -> ELF
